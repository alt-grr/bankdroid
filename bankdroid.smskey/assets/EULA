SMS Key TM is created to make life easy. Originally it was created to make the developer's life easier, however it proved to be useful for thousands of people around the world.
It is NOT a product of any of the supported bank or institution. It is developed and maintained as open source project and with the support of the Android user community.
So you can use the application freely, even the source of the application is open. 
Although I designed and tested the application carefully, I cannot provide any warranty, the sotfware is provided "as is".
Anyway, if you have any issues with the application you can contact me through e-mail address available on the Market.

... the developer.
